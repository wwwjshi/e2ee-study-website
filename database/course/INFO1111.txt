INFO1111: Computing 1A Professionalism
This unit introduces students to the fundamental principles that underlie professional practice in computing. It lays the foundation for later studies, and presents to the students challenges common to a multidisciplinary IT environment. The subject also provides students with the opportunity to develop important attributes such as communication skills, an understanding of professional ethics, and of working as a part of a team. Tool use is an important aspect of this unit: students are required to learn to use tools for planning and completing work, managing artefacts including reports, and communicating within the team. A selection of guest speakers will address students on different career paths. Dalyell students may enrol in ENGD1000 Building a Sustainable World in place of INFO1111
